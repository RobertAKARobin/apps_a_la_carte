							<p>If it's your first time building an app, or you've only worked with freelancers and overseas developers, it might!</p>

							<p>This estimate is based on my experience as a &ldquo;Solutions Architect&rdquo; for a mid-size development shop based in the US and Bulgaria, called <a href="http://www.mentormate.com">MentorMate</a>.</p>

							<p>How much your app <em>actually</em> costs may be more, or may be less. Things change based on the specific features you want, and even more based on how much <em>risk</em> you're willing to take.</p>

							<h2>What is &ldquo;risk&rdquo;?</h2>

							<p>It's a measure of how sure you can be that you'll get a functioning, finished product. An established development company with a lot of customers and experience is low-risk. Their development will include quality assurance testing and project management because they have a brand to protect. This may cost more in the short-term, but should make up for it in the long-term because you won't need to spend so much fixing bugs, and a better product will bring in more revenue.</p>

							<p>On the other hand, hiring a freelancer, a technical co-founder, or an offshore development company is high-risk. They may cost less in the short-term, but may also cost much more in the long-term because you don't have the &ldquo;safety net&rdquo; of a team of people all working to manage your development experience. Making an app is a complicated process, and a lack of accountability and experience can quickly spiral into a storm of bugs and un-met promises.</p>

							<p>What balance of risk and cost is best? That's up to you!</p>

							<h2>Want to talk about it?</h2>

							<p>I'm <a href="http://www.robertakarobin.com">Robin</a>! My hobby is now my job: When people have an app idea I get to help them flesh out what it will look like from a technical and design standpoint, and then estimate its cost. My last job was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/43s5re/i_teach_coding_to_total_beginners_in_a_fulltime/">teaching programming</a> to beginners.</p>

							<p>I built this tool because a lot of people have really great app ideas but aren't sure how what they need to bring that idea to life, or how to budget for it.</p>

							<p>I really enjoy talking about this stuff, and a conversation doesn't cost anything. Fill out the information below and I'll write back as quick as I can!</p>
